# Find Town Judge

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1

Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= trust.length <= 104`
- `trust[i].length == 2`
- All the pairs of trust are unique.
- `ai != bi`
- `1 <= ai, bi <= n`

## Solution

```ts
export function findJudge(n: number, trust: number[][]): number {
	if (trust.length === 0 && n === 1) return 1

	const map = new Map<number, number>()
	const followersmap = new Map<number, number>()

	for (let [a, b] of trust) {
		if (!map.has(a)) map.set(a, 0)
		if (!map.has(b)) map.set(b, 0)
		if (!followersmap.has(b)) followersmap.set(b, 0)

		const prev = map.get(a)!
		map.set(a, prev + 1)

		const prev_b = followersmap.get(b)!
		followersmap.set(b, prev_b + 1)
	}

	for (let [key, value] of map) {
		if (value === 0 && followersmap.get(key) === n - 1) return key
	}

	return -1
}
```
