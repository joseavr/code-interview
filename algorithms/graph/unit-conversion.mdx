## Unit Conversion

Write a program that answer unit conversion
Given a two lists,

1 meters -> x inch?

example facts:
m = 3.28 ft
ft = 12 in
hr = 60 min
min = 60 sec

example queries:
2 m = 7 in -> answer = 78.72
13 in = ? m -> answer = 0.330 (roughly)  
 13 in = ? hr -> "not convertible"

inputs:
facts: [ ["m", 3.28, "ft"], ... ]
queries: [13, "in " , "m"]

```js
/**
 *
 *
 * SOL:
 * we know that
 *  1  in (a)   ->   _   m (b)
 *  13 in (c)   ->   x   m (d)
 *
 * return: d = c * b
 *
 * prase facts:
 * {
 *  "m" : ["3.28 ft", "_ in"]
 *  "ft" : ["_ m", "_ in" ]
 *  "in": ["_ m", "_ ft"]
 *  ...
 * }
 *
 *
